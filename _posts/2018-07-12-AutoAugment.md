# How to improve your image classifier with Google's AutoAugment

![Blogpost](../images/autoaugment1.png)

I wrote a blog post about Google's [AutoAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501v3) and Double Transfer Learning on Medium. You can find it [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-improve-your-image-classifier-with-googles-autoaugment-77643f0be0c9).
There is also a git repository with my implementation available [here](https://github.com/DeepVoltaire/AutoAugment).
